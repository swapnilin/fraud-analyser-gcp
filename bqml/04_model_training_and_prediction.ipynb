    "[FraudFinder](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/fraudfinder) is a series of labs on how to build a real-time fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the FraudFinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse, read from a live stream of new transactions, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering, ingest features into a feature store, train a model using feature store, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model with feature store, and monitor your model."

    "\n",
    "After feature engineering and ingesting data into a feature store, you are now ready to train and deploy your machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, using the data in Vertex AI Feature Store that you previously ingested data into, you will train a model using BigQuery ML, register the model to Vertex AI Model Registry, and deploy it to an endpoint for real-time prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a logistic regression model in BigQuery using BigQuery ML\n",
    "- Evaluate the model\n",
    "- Test a prediction \n",
    "- Deploy to an endpoint on Vertex AI\n",
    "- Make an online prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Google Cloud data analytics and services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)\n",
    "- [BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/)\n",
    "- [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Python & SQL to query the data in BigQuery\n",
    "- Preparing the data for modeling\n",
    "- Training a classification model using BigQuery ML and registering it to Vertex AI Model Registry\n",
    "- Inspecting the model on Vertex AI Model Registry\n",
    "- Deploying the model to an endpoint on Vertex AI\n",
    "- Making sample online predictions to the model endpoint\n",

    "In the previous labs `02_feature_engineering_batch.ipynb` and `03_feature_engineering_streaming`, you computed features and ingested them into Vertex AI Feature Store. You can now look back into Feature Store to any point in time and output those values from Feature Store in batch to a BigQuery table in order to train your machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in these Fraudfinder labs, the ground-truth fraud labels are already available for all transactions, even as soon as a new transaction occurs. However, in practice, there is usually a delay (in the order of _days_) between when a transaction occurs until it gets officially flagged as a fraudulent transaction by a fraud department. Because of this, if the data you use to train on doesn't yet have the up-to-date information about whether it's truly fraud or not, you may end up training an ML model on incorrect data (i.e. on transactions that are actually fraud, but were labeled as not-fraud at the time of training). If this is the case, then when you choose what data you use for training a model, be sure you use the point-in-time by \"time-traveling\" an appropriate number of days into the past to a date when you're confident that the labels should be accurate when fetching feature values from Vertex AI Feature Store. For this notebook, you will simply be \"time traveling\" to yesterday for simplicity.\n",
